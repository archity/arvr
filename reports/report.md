> ## Manipulating videos and media remotely by using the Androidâ€™s motion sensors

## 1. Context (Background & Motivations)

Media production as well as consumption is on the rise since quite some time, and with the advent of smartphones, the consumption has only increased even more. People consume media on various types of devices ranging from smartphones, televisions and computer. Traditionally media controlling has been primarily done through physical buttons present on the television set itself, and later on, all those functionalities were transferred to a small rectangular device dubbed as 'remote' which consists of several physical buttons.

Our original idea consisted of having an application running in the background of an Android device which would have the ability to control the media devices present around the house. We could simply pickup our Android device lying around and with a chosen long-press on the screen, we could move the phone around in specific orientation in order to control the television playing a movie.


## 2. Problem Addressed

The problem that we focussed mainly on was the control of media devices, more specifically, control the current video playing on a computer. The various actions that we wanted to control can be grouped and summarized in the following figure.

Our idea was to group the different functionalities based on the phone's orientation.
